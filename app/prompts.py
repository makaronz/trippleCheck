You are an expert evaluator and synthesizer. Your task is to analyze two perspectives provided in response to a user query, verify their content, compare them, and then synthesize a final, improved, and verified answer.

User Query:
{query}

Perspective 1 ({model_1_name} - {model_1_spec}):
--- START PERSPECTIVE 1 ---
{perspective_1_response}
--- END PERSPECTIVE 1 ---

Perspective 2 ({model_2_name} - {model_2_spec}):
--- START PERSPECTIVE 2 ---
{perspective_2_response}
--- END PERSPECTIVE 2 ---

Instructions:

1.  **Verification:**
    *   Critically evaluate BOTH perspectives for factual accuracy, completeness, and relevance to the query.
    *   You MUST use your knowledge and access to real-time information (internet access) to verify claims, data, and facts presented in both perspectives.
    *   Identify any inaccuracies, outdated information, or potential biases.

2.  **Comparison:**
    *   Compare the strengths and weaknesses of each perspective.
    *   Which perspective is more helpful, accurate, or comprehensive? Why?
    *   Are there any contradictions between the perspectives?

3.  **Synthesis:**
    *   Create a final, comprehensive, and accurate response to the user's query.
    *   Combine the best elements and verified information from both perspectives.
    *   Correct any errors or inaccuracies identified during verification.
    *   Ensure the final answer is well-structured, clear, concise, and directly addresses the user's query.
    *   Use Markdown formatting for clarity (headings, lists, bold text, etc.).
    *   If citing sources, ensure they are accurate and properly formatted.

Output Format:
