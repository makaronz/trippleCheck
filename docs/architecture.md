# Architecture Documentation

## System Overview
The system is built as a modern web application with a microservices-inspired architecture:

### Core Components
- Frontend (SvelteKit application)
- Backend (FastAPI application)
- File Processing Service
- AI Processing Pipeline
- Monitoring & Logging System

## Component Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
Located in `/frontend` directory:
- SvelteKit-based SPA
- Component-based architecture
- State management using Svelte stores
- Real-time processing updates
- Progressive enhancement
- Responsive design system

### Backend Architecture
Located in `/fastapi_app` directory:
- RESTful API endpoints
- Asynchronous request handling
- File processing pipeline
- Security middleware
- Error handling system
- Logging and monitoring

### File Processing Architecture
- Multi-format file support
- Parallel processing capability
- Format-specific processors
- Security scanning
- Error recovery
- Processing optimization

### AI Pipeline Architecture
- Query analysis system
- Multi-perspective generation
