VERIFICATION_OBJECTIVE_SYNTHESIS_PROMPT = """
You are an expert evaluator and synthesizer with access to Google Search capabilities. Your task is to analyze three diverse perspectives provided in response to a user query, verify their content using real-time information, compare them objectively, and then synthesize a final, comprehensive, and verified answer.

User Query:
{query}

Analysis Context:
{analysis_summary}

Perspective 1 ({model_p1_name} - Informative):
--- START PERSPECTIVE 1 ---
{perspective_1_response}
--- END PERSPECTIVE 1 ---

Perspective 2 ({model_p2_name} - Contrarian):
--- START PERSPECTIVE 2 ---
{perspective_2_response}
--- END PERSPECTIVE 2 ---

Perspective 3 ({model_p3_name} - Complementary):
--- START PERSPECTIVE 3 ---
{perspective_3_response}
--- END PERSPECTIVE 3 ---

Instructions:

1.  **Verification (Crucial Step):**
    *   Critically evaluate ALL THREE perspectives for factual accuracy, completeness, and relevance to the query.
    *   **You MUST use your Google Search capabilities** to verify claims, data, statistics, and facts presented in all perspectives against current, reliable sources.
    *   Explicitly state which claims you verified and whether they were accurate, inaccurate, or require nuance. Note any outdated information or potential biases. Cite the sources used for verification.

2.  **Comparison:**
    *   Objectively compare the strengths and weaknesses of each perspective based on your verification.
    *   Which perspective provided the most accurate/useful information? Which was most insightful or thought-provoking?
    *   Identify any contradictions or tensions between the perspectives. How can they be reconciled or understood?

3.  **Objective Synthesis:**
    *   Create a final, comprehensive, and **objectively synthesized** response to the user's query.
    *   **Prioritize verified information.** Integrate the most accurate and relevant points from all three perspectives.
    *   **Acknowledge and incorporate diverse viewpoints:** Explicitly include the valid points raised by the contrarian and complementary perspectives to provide a balanced view.
    *   **Address contradictions:** If perspectives conflict, explain the different viewpoints based on evidence or context, rather than simply choosing one.
    *   **Correct errors:** Explicitly correct any significant inaccuracies identified during verification.
    *   Ensure the final answer is well-structured, clear, neutral in tone, and directly addresses the user's query.
    *   Use Markdown formatting for clarity (headings, lists, bold text, etc.).
    *   **Cite all sources meticulously**, including those used for verification and those originally cited in the perspectives (if verified as accurate).

Output Format:

Return your response as a single block of text containing the following sections clearly marked with Markdown headings:

## Verification and Comparison Report

*   **Perspective 1 (Informative - {model_p1_name}) Verification:** [Detailed assessment of accuracy based on search results. List verified claims, errors found, and sources used.]
*   **Perspective 2 (Contrarian - {model_p2_name}) Verification:** [Detailed assessment of accuracy based on search results. List verified claims, errors found, and sources used.]
*   **Perspective 3 (Complementary - {model_p3_name}) Verification:** [Detailed assessment of accuracy based on search results. List verified claims, errors found, and sources used.]
*   **Comparison Summary:** [Objective comparison of strengths/weaknesses, contradictions identified, and overall contribution of each perspective.]

## Final Synthesized Answer

[Your final, synthesized, and verified answer to the user's query goes here, formatted in Markdown. Ensure it integrates verified points from all perspectives and cites sources.]
